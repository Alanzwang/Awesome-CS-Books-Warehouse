# Dont Make Me Think. A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability.

Here are a few things you **won't** find in this book:

- Hard and fast usability rules
- Predictions about the future of technology and the Web
- Bad-mouthing of poorly designed sites and apps.

You'll find a lot of different definitions of usability often breaking it down into attributes like:

- Useful: Does it do something people need done?
- Learnable: Can people figure out how to use it?
- Memorable: Do they have to relearn it each time they use
- Effective: Does it get the job done?
- Efficient: Does it do it with a reasonable amount of time and effort?
- Desirable: Do people want it?
- Delightful: Is using it enjoyable, or even fun?

# Dont make me think

What's the most important thing I should do if i want to make sure my site or app is easy to use? It's not "Nothing important should ever be more than two clicks away" or "Speak the user' s language" or "Be consistent." It's Dont make me think.

All kinds of things on a Web page can make us stop and think unnecessarily. Your goal should be for each page or screen to be self-evident, so that just by looking at it the average user. Here's the rule: If you can t make something self-evident, you at least need to make it self-explanatory.

On a self-explanatory page, it takes a little thought to get it, but only a little. The appearance of things (like size, color, and layout), their well-chosen names, and the small amounts of carefully crafted text should all work together to create a sense of nearly effortless understanding.

# How we really use the Web

When we're creating Sites, we act as though people are going to pore over each page, reading all of our carefully crafted text, figuring out how we've organized things, and weighing their options before deciding which link to click.

What they actually do most of the time (if were lucky is glance at each new page, scan some of the text, and click on the first link that catches their interest or vaguely resembles the thing they're looking for.

- FACT OF LIFE #1: **We dont read pages. We scan them**

- FACT OF LIFE #2: **We dont make optimal choices. We satisfice.**

- FACT OF LIFE #3: **We don't figure out how things work. We muddle through.**

**DESIGNING FOR SCANNING, NOT READING**

## Take advantage of conventions

Like Stop signs, Given how crucial it is that drivers see and recognize them at a glance at a distance, in all kinds of weather and lighting conditions, it's a really good thing that all stop signs look the same.

## Create effective visual hierarchies

- The more important something is, the more prominent it is.
- Things that are related logically are related visually.
- Things are"nested visually to show what's part of what

## Break pages up into clearly defined areas

Web page scanning suggest that users decide very quickly in their initial glances which parts of the page are likely to have useful information and then rarely look at the other parts.

Banner blindness-the ability of users to completely ignore areas they think will
contain ads--is just the extreme case.

## Make it obvious what's clickable

As we scan a page, we're looking for a variety of visual cues that identify things as clickable(or tappable?'on touch screens )-things like shape(buttons, tabs, etc.), location(in a menu bar, for instance), and formatting(color and underlining).

## Eliminate distractions/noise

One of the great enemies of easy-to-grasp pages is visual noise. There are really three different kinds of noise:

- Shouting: Automated slideshows, animation, pop-ups, and the never-ending array of new attention-grabbing ad formats! Shouting is usually the result of a failure to make tough decisions about which elements are really the most important and then create a visual hierarchy that guides users to them first.

- Disorganization: This is a sure sign that the designer doesn’t understand the importance of using grids to align the elements on a page.

- Clutter: It’s hard to find and focus on the messages you actually care about.

A good idea to start with the assumption that everything is visual noise (the “presumed guilty until proven innocent” approach) and get rid of anything that’s not making a real contribution.

## Format content to support scanning

- Use plenty of headings.
- Keep paragraphs short.
- Use bulleted lists.
- Highlight key terms.

# Animal, Vegetable, or Mineral? WHY USERS LIKE MINDLESS CHOICES

It doesn’t matter how many times I have to click, as long as each click is a mindless, unambiguous. But over time I’ve come to think that what really counts is not the number of clicks it takes me to get to what I want (although there are limits), but rather how hard each click is—the amount of thought required and the amount of uncertainty about whether I’m making the right choice.

## Some assistance may be required

This guidance works best when it’s

- Brief: The smallest amount of information that will help me
- Timely: Placed so I encounter it exactly when I need it
- Unavoidable: Formatted in a way that ensures that I’ll notice it

# Omit needless words

# Mobile: It’s not just a city in Alabama anymore

So, what’s different about usability when you’re designing for use on a mobile device?In one sense, the answer is: Not much. The basic principles are still the same. If anything, people are
moving faster and reading even less on small screens. Most of the challenges in creating good mobile usability boil down to making good tradeoffs.

Which parts do you leave out? One approach was Mobile First. Instead of designing a full-featured (and perhaps bloated) version of your Web site first and then paring it down to create the mobile version, you design the mobile version first based on the features and content that are most important to your users. Then you add on more features and content to create the desktop/full version

If there are two things I can tell you about scalable design (a/k/a dynamic layout, fluid design, adaptive design, and responsive design), they’re these:
- It tends to be a lot of work.
- It’s very hard to do it well.

In the meantime, here are three suggestions:

- Allow zooming.

- Don’t leave me standing at the front door. You tap on a link in an email or a social media site and instead of taking you to the article in question it takes you to the mobile Home page, leaving you to hunt for the thing yourself.

- Always provide a link to the “full” Web site.
